Because a single user can be a member of multiple organizations, the **Select Organisation** screen appears immediately after login.

### 1. System Requirements

To ensure the best experience, please use one of the following supported web browsers:

* Google Chrome (Recommended)
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari

> Note: Please ensure your browser is up to date. Internet Explorer is not supported.

### 2. The "First-Time" Experience

What you see upon your first login depends on your role and the status of your organization.

#### Scenario A: You are a New Fleet Administrator

If you are the first person logging into a brand-new organization, you will be greeted by the Onboarding Wizard. This is a guided setup designed to get your operations running in minutes.

You will be asked to:

1. Add Your First Vehicle: Enter the registration number and IMEI of your GPS device.
2. Create a Group: Organize your fleet (e.g., "North Zone" or "Heavy Trucks") to manage permissions easily.
3. Invite Team Members: Add email addresses for your dispatchers or managers so they can access the platform.

> Tip: You can skip these steps and complete them later in Settings, but we recommend adding at least one vehicle to enable the Dashboard view.

#### Scenario B: You are an Invited User

If you were invited to an existing organization, you will land directly on the Live Dashboard.

* Map View: You will see all vehicles assigned to you plotted on the map.
* Status Indicators: Vehicles are color-coded (Green for Moving, Red for Stopped, Grey for Inactive).

### 3. Navigating the Workspace

The Bolt V2 interface is divided into three main areas:

#### A. The Sidebar (Main Menu)

Located on the left, this is your primary navigation tool.

* Dashboard: Real-time overview of fleet statistics.
* Live Tracking: Detailed map view with vehicle controls.
* Reports: Access history, mileage, and trip logs.
* Yard Management: (If enabled) Manage dock and warehouse operations.
* Settings: Configure alerts, geofences, and user profiles.

#### B. The Top Bar

* Global Search: Quickly find a vehicle by name, tag, or IMEI.
* Notifications (Bell Icon): View critical alerts like overspeeding or geofence breaches.
* Profile Menu: Access your account settings and logout.

### 4. Personalizing Your Account

Before you start tracking, we recommend setting up your preferences.

1. Navigate to Settings > Profile.
2. Language: Select your preferred language (English or Hindi).
3. Security: Update your password if you are using a temporary one provided by your admin.
4. Notifications: Choose whether you want alerts via Email, SMS, or Mobile App Push Notifications.
