* Request Access: To start a new organization, please contact your Account Manager or email `support@roadcast.in`.

#### B. Team Members (Dispatchers & Managers)

If you are joining an existing fleet:

### 2. Logging In

If you do not remember your password or prefer a password-less login:

4. Enter Code: Input the code in the OTP Verification screen.
5. Click "Verify" to access your dashboard.

### 3. First-Time Setup Steps

When logging in for the first time, the system may guide you through a few required steps.

#### Step 1: Account Verification

* Screen: `Verify Account`
* Action: If your account is pending verification, you will be prompted to confirm your identity via a link sent to your registered email.

#### Step 2: Select Organization

* Screen: `Select Organisation`
* Action: If your email is associated with multiple fleets (e.g., a logistics manager handling two different branches), you must select which organization you wish to view for the current session.

#### Step 3: Admin Onboarding (The "Get Started" Wizard)

* Who sees this? Only Administrators of brand-new organizations.
* Trigger: This screen appears automatically if your organization has zero vehicles or assets.
* Action: The wizard will guide you to:
  1. Add Vehicles: Register your first GPS devices.
  2. Create Groups: Organize your fleet (e.g., "North Zone").
  3. Invite Users: Add your team members.
  * _Note: Once you add your first asset, this wizard will disappear, and you will be taken directly to the Dashboard on future logins._
