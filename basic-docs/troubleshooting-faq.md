# Troubleshooting FAQ

* **Inactive Devices:** If a vehicle is showing as "Inactive," first verify the "Sky View" for GPS signal. Use the built-in **Troubleshoot** tool to check SIM connectivity and power status.
* **Odometer Sync:** Digital odometers may drift from physical dashboard readings over time. Use the **Sync Odometer** feature to manually calibrate the system to match the vehicle's physical state.
* **Service Scheduling:** Set maintenance alerts based on either time intervals (e.g., 6 months) or distance intervals (e.g., 10,000 km) synced from the vehicle's odometer.
